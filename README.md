# 0-shanten

0-shanten is a stack-based esoteric programming language that is inspired by [riichi
mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong) and uses only characters from the [Mahjong
Tiles](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F000.pdf) Unicode block. All other characters are ignored.

For a quick introduction to the language, see: [hello_world.0sh](examples/hello_world.0sh)
